# A

## Artefact

Artefacts are immutable things which are produced within DevOps processes. They are the things which are deployed in a release pipeline.

## Asset

Assets "things" which get produced within a project. Products might contain multiple assets which together make up the whole product. An example of an asset would be a Python library or a data set. These can be used together to refine the data and produce the end customer facing product.

# D

## Data Consumer

Data Consumers will consume data within the ecosystem. These may create new data products to be consumed elsewhere, or may present data with some kind of presentation layer directly to users or systems.

## Data Provider

Data Providers create data in the ecosystem. These can be data products which generate new data (source systems, test data, random data) or they can be data products which bring in other data (external data , for instance). Usually these data sources should be registered in a data catalogue to make them discoverable. The team is responsible for managing changes to source schemas and their integration into target schemas. Normally the team will include people who also manage the source systems, to ensure this is carried out in a timely manner. 

## Delivery Team

The multi-disciplinary team developing a data product. This will often include DevOps engineers, data engineers, infrastructure, networking, security and other skills and is intended to avoid the need to reach out to other teams and raise change requests. Self sufficiency and empowerment are key to a good team.

# P

## Product

A data product is a self contained thing which delivers something to one or more "customers". It has a lifecycle and delivery schedule, as well as feedback mechanisms to allow requirements and user stories to be added and changed over time. A data product may be an ML model, data set, application, library, or any other component product within a data ecosystem.

## Product Owner

A product owner is the person responsible for the product, its development and roadmap, as well as justification for the budget and product which will include marketing to user populations who consume the product. This is no different to a product owner in a software house.

## Project

A Project is the governance around the product lifecycle. This allows tracking of issues, features, bugs etc. As well as managing work and teams to get the product delivered.
